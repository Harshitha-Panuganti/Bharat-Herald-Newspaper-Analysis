Bharat Herald Problem Statement:
Bharat Herald, a 70-year-old legacy newspaper, is struggling to
survive due to a sharp decline in print circulation (from 1.2M to 560K
between 2019â€“2024) and failure to adapt digitally. While competitors
adopted mobile-first platforms and subscription models, its 2021
epaper pilot failed. This has led to falling advertiser confidence,
delayed vendor payments, bureau closures, and layoffs of 60+
employees. An internal audit now highlights severe financial distress,
putting the organization at risk of collapse.
